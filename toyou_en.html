                        <p class="lead">The first boss you'll have to face in INIAD is the compulsory math subject</p>
                        <small class="text-decoration-line-through">then the 2nd one would be math in 2nd year...</small>
                        <p>The difficulty of the math exam goes up every year so please study in order not to retake (and I'm also saying this to myself as well)</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2 class="display-6 text-center">Are you a good fit for INIAD?</h2>
                        <p class="lead">If you find yourself relating to the following traits you might not be a good fit. Please note that I only speak for myself and my opinions do not represent the department.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You don't like studying.</li>
                            <li>You want to get credits without having to pay much hard work.</li>
                            <li>You don't have anything particular you want to do in your university life.</li>
                            <li>You want to play as much as you can during university.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">On the contrary, if you relate to any of the traits below, you may be a good fit for INIAD.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You are interested in new technology and eager to learn on a deeper scale.</li>
                            <li>You haven't decided on what exactly you want to do, but you do want to give different things a try.</li>
                            <li>You are a work-hard-play-hard person.</li>
                            <li>(Of course) you like computers and/or ICT.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">On another note, there is no exchange program held by INIAD itself, howevever you can reach out to the International Affairs Office (IAO) at Toyo for any other non-department-specific exchange programs.</p>

                        <h3 class="display-6">How is the support for intl students?</h3>
                        <p class="lead">It's the same as what a domestic student would get. However, the people in the department office do not speak English.</p>
                        <p>Most subjects provide lecture notes in English, there are classes that are Japanese-only. (Though in such cases it's better to just reach out to your lecturer)</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3 class="display-6">Is there any sort of international students' organization?</h3>
                        <p class="lead">There is not any within INIAD, however there are student-led organizations like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/toyo.tia/">TIA</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/toyo.gemstone.official">TGS</a> from Toyo Univerisity itself. Besides, there is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ecz_toyo.akabanedai/">ECZ</a> located in the WELLB Building in Akabanedai Campus that opens twice a week.</p>
                        <p>You get a way better experience if you live in AI-HOUSE nearby! It's the easiest space for you to communicate with other international students (as well as domestic students) from other departments. INIAD itself does not have a lot of international students from what I've seen, there's only like 2 or 3 non-Japanese passing students which I'm not sure if they are even an international student (that is studying abroad in Japan like me).</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3 class="display-6">Are there any scholarships?</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Go to <a href="https://www.toyo.ac.jp/campuslife/student_support/award/award_ssa/">the Toyo Univerisity official website</a> for more details.</p>
                        <p>In short, it's better to default most scholarships are not international students friendly, though there are ones that are specific to international students.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="you-tab-pane" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="you-tab" tabindex="0">
                        <h3 class="display-6">I want to know more about INIAD.</h3>
                        <p class="lead">You can go to <a href="https://www.iniad.org/">the department website</a> or <a href="https://www.toyo.ac.jp/academics/iniad/diniad/">Toyo Univerisity's official website</a> for more details.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3 class="display-6">How do you feel about the location of the campus?</h3>
                        <p class="lead">It's a 10-minute walk away from JR Akabane Station so it's rather on the easy-to-access side of things, however there is a steep slope in the way which might be a hustle to some.</p>
                        <p>It's located at the West Exit of Akabane Station, which is not the place with a lot of Izakaya's (which is on the east side), that makes it located at a rather quiet and focused place. Meanwhile, school clubs and students often go to the east side for drinking events.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3 class="display-6">Is there a canteen/cafeteria within the campus?</h3>
                        <p class="lead">There used to be one in INIAD (or so I think). It's now used as a common area for students.</p>
                        <p>There is one in the WELLB building right next to it. As it is the only dining space available throughout the whole Akabanedai Campus, it gets very crowded during lunch hours.</p>
                        <p>There is something similar to a convenience store in the INIAD building which serves as an alternative to the students canteen in WELLB, and its 150 yen fried soba is pretty popular among students.</p>
