                        <p class="card-text">Unfortunately, there are not a lot of chances to interact with students from other departments if you don't reach out. Clubs are mostly department-specific. However, as a department of Toyo university, you can always join clubs and events organized by other departments or in other campuses.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The campus itself is not very big, however the student dormitory right next to it <a href="https://toyo.749.cc/aihouse/" class="link-info fw-bold">AI-HOUSE</a> fosters international communication actively. Personally, I stay there more than I do at the university campus.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">There are quite a number of subjects that has group projects that require you to develop something as a team. Though, in most cases the groupmates just stay groupmates, but some people do manage to make a connection out of them.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">There are cases of graduates entering big tech companies or MNCs. Alumni talks from different companies are held quite often in-campus.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Most students seem to be pretty aware of job searching in the market. There are students who find internships and make their portfolios as early as their first year in INIAD. It feels like a place where aspiring developers gather and share information.</p>
